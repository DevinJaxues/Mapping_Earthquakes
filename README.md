## Overview ##
---
The objective of this project was to create a map that achieved 3 main goals being access to GeoJSON data, interactiveness, and visualize said data.

- I was able to achieve the fetching of the GeoJSON data through the Javascript logic file.
Which we get using d3 and the source https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates

- Interactiveness was achieved via multiple methods
  - Zoom in/out
  - Earthquake point data
  - Legend buttons to turn on or off display of earthquakes, major earthquakes and tectonic plates

- And lastly the color legend in the bottom right explains scale of earthquakes which is then visualized on the data points using said colors and size of data dot on the map
